# ASR experiments: Qwen3-ASR batching (Step 103) and MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize (Step 104)

Both are **off by default** and switched on in React **Settings > Transcription
experiments** (PC only). Nothing here changes a default. Whether either one
becomes a default is a later decision, made after the real comparison below.

## What was built

| | Step 103: Qwen3-ASR batching | Step 104: MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize |
|---|---|---|
| Setting | `qwen_asr_batch_size`, 1-16, default 1 (1 = the original one-segment-at-a-time run) | `moss_experimental`, default off |
| Applies when | a drama's ASR backend is **Qwen3 ASR** in Whisper-text mode | a drama's ASR backend is **MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize (experimental)** in Whisper-text mode |
| Code | `asr_backend.Qwen3ASRBackend.transcribe(batch_size=...)` | `asr_backend.MossTranscribeDiarizeBackend`, `BACKENDS`/`get_backend` |
| Written against | qwen-asr **0.0.6** (`transcribe(list)` returns one result per input, in order) | OpenMOSS/MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize commit **61bc29c** (package 0.1.0) |
| Safety | results keyed back by segment index; a batch with the wrong result count is redone one segment at a time; timing is always Whisper's | never picked automatically; refused unless the toggle is on and the package is installed; its own speaker labels are kept and pyannote is not chained over them |

MOSS is not on PyPI and needs Transformers >= 5.6, while qwen-asr pins
Transformers 4.57.6, so the two can't share one Python environment. Diagnostics
lists it (`moss-transcribe-diarize`) but does not offer a pip install.

## How to evaluate (the roadmap's method)

Use the same held-out, already-reviewed clips for every run: narration,
dialogue, music under speech, quiet speech, overlapping speakers. For each clip
record transcription error (CER against the reviewed text) and diarization
error (speaker labels against the reviewed speakers) separately, plus wall-clock
time and peak GPU memory (`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used --format=csv -l 1`).

- **Step 103:** run Qwen3 ASR with batch size 1, then 4 and 8, on the same
  clips. Batching may be adopted only if no clip's text changes for the worse.
- **Step 104:** run Whisper + speaker detection, then MOSS, on the same clips.
  Write the go/no-go recommendation here, with the numbers.

*Not run yet: needs the user's GPU PC.*
